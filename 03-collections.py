# Python Operators

# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
# Python divides the operators in the following groups:
    # Arithmetic operators
    # Assignment operators
    # Comparison operators
    # Logical operators
    # Identity operators
    # Membership operators
    # Bitwise operators

# Python Collections (Arrays)

# There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
#     List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
#     Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
#     Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
#     Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
# ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] 


# Access Items
# You access the list items by referring to the index number:
print(thislist[1])
# banana

# Change Item Value
# To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:
thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"
print(thislist)
# ['apple', 'blackcurrant', 'cherry'] 


# Loop Through a List
# You can loop through the list items by using a for loop:
for x in thislist:
  print(x) 
# apple
# banana
# cherry 


# Check if Item Exists
# To determine if a specified item is present in a list use the in keyword:
if "apple" in thislist:
  print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits list") 
# Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits list 


# List Length
# To determine how many items a list have, use the len() method:
print(len(thislist))
# 3


# Add Items
# To add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method:
thislist.append("orange")
print(thislist)
# ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange'] 


# To add an item at the specified index, use the insert() method:
thislist.insert(1, "orange")
print(thislist)
# ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'cherry'] 


# Remove Item
# There are several methods to remove items from a list:
# The remove() method removes the specified item:
thislist.remove("banana")
print(thislist)
# ['apple', 'cherry']
